## 📖 Usage

### Main Interface

1. **Map View**: The main map displays cattle locations with numbered markers (🐄 1, 🐄 2, etc.)
2. **Click on Markers**: Click any cattle marker to view its journey progress
3. **Hover for Details**: Hover over markers to see detailed information popup
4. **Live Updates**: Data refreshes automatically every 5 seconds

### Data Visualization

- **Bar Chart**: Shows distribution of cattle across different farm stops
- **Data Table**: Displays detailed information about each cattle including:
  - Cattle ID
  - Current Stop
  - Status (Moving, Grazing, Reached)
  - Distance Travelled
  - Remaining Distance
  - Grazing Time
  - Walking Time

    └── cattles.json    # Cattle data (100 entries)
```

## 📊 Data Format

The `cattles.json` file contains an array of cattle objects with the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "currentStop": 1,
  "status": "Moving",
  "travelled": 4,
  "remaining": 7,
  "grazingTime": 30,
  "walkingTime": 120
}
```

### Data Fields

- `id`: Unique cattle identifier
- `currentStop`: Current stop index (0-8)
- `status`: Current activity ("Moving", "Grazing", "Reached")
- `travelled`: Distance covered in kilometers
- `remaining`: Distance remaining to next stop
- `grazingTime`: Time spent grazing in seconds
- `walkingTime`: Time spent walking in seconds

### Farm Stops

The application tracks cattle movement through 9 predefined stops:

1. **Central Barn** (Stop 0)
2. **Water Trough** (Stop 1)
3. **Mango Orchard** (Stop 2)
4. **Open Grazing Field** (Stop 3)
5. **Mud Pond** (Stop 4)
6. **Wheat Zone** (Stop 5)
7. **Milking Station** (Stop 6)
8. **Shed Crossing** (Stop 7)
9. **Main Shelter** (Stop 8)

## 🔧 API Reference

### Main Functions

#### `initMap()`
Initializes the interactive map with cattle markers.

#### `initTable()`
Populates the data table with cattle information.

#### `initChart()`
Creates the bar chart for cattle distribution.

#### `updateAll()`
Updates all data and visualizations (called every 5 seconds).

#### `drawGraph(cattle)`
Generates the journey progress graph for a specific cattle.

### Data Updates

The application simulates real-time updates by:
- Randomly changing cattle status between "Moving" and "Grazing"
- Incrementing travel distances for moving cattle
- Updating time counters for grazing and walking
- Moving cattle to next stops when distance targets are reached

## 🎨 Customization

### Styling

Modify `style.css` to change:
- Color schemes
- Layout arrangements
- Font styles
- Responsive breakpoints

### Map Configuration

In `script.js`, update:
- `stopLocations[]`: GPS coordinates for farm stops
- `stops[]`: Names of farm locations
- Map center and zoom level

### Data Source

Replace `data/cattles.json` with your own cattle data or integrate with a real-time API.
